# Cybersecurity_Risk_Server

Created a neural network model in Python to predict malicious threats using serversâ€™ anonymized logging parameters from Kaggle 

Determined 17 significant predictors by utilizing exploratory analysis and implemented grid search with 100 hidden layers nodes

Achieved a 97% accuracy rate in detecting the risk of a hacked server based on higher anonymized logging parameters in each item
